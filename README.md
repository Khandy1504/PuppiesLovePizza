# PuppiesLovePizza
 This is a 2D shooter were a player shoots pizza at puppies to feed them. The player can move left and right and use space bar to shoot the pizza. Different puppies require different amounts of pizza. If a puppy gets past the player unfed the log with display game over. 

 This game was written in C# and built in Unity Game Engine. I learned how to create health bars, how to destroy objects once they have left the screen, how to randomly spawn objects in the game, and implementing the detection of collisions.
